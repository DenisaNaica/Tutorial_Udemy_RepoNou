                    Summer is here and that means it’s potluck season. Bring on the backyard barbecues, the
                    <br>
                    rooftop soirees and the outdoor dinners. Whenever I’m invited to these events I always want
                    <br>
                    to bring that one dish that wows the other guests. You want to hear people whispering,
                    <br>
                    “What’s in this? Who made it? How do I get the recipe?” while they shove another forkful in their mouths
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pasta salad is always a good choice to bring to these types of parties: It can be made ahead of
                    <br>
                    time and tastes better the longer it sits. But there’s one problem ― it can be boring and
                    <br>
                    flavorless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But good news: Making a stellar pasta salad only takes one simple ingredient you probably
                    <br>
                    already have in the back of your fridge … pickle juice!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using the leftover brine from a jar of pickles isn’t a new phenomenon: It’s been used to
                    <br>
                    marinate chicken, cure hangovers, add a zing to bloody marys and even relieve cramps in
                    <br>athletes. The juice and spices at the bottom of the jar are a delicious combination of vinegar,
                    <br>.
                    garlic, dill, mustard seeds, peppercorns and coriander seeds. It adds a brightness to dishes
                    <br>
                    with a pop of acidity, sourness and tang. Think of it as a one-stop shop for flavor
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this recipe, the pickle juice cuts the richness of the mayo in a dill-heavy ranch dressing
                    <br>
                    while adding a briny punch of flavor. The pasta salad also includes perfectly al dente noodles,
                    <br>
                    a good measure of diced pickles, hunks of sharp cheddar cheese, fresh summer tomatoes and
                    <br>
                    of course extra crispy thick-cut bacon. It’s basically all of your favorite foods combined into
                    <br>
                    one dish and conveniently called a “salad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next time you’re looking to be the culinary superstar of the summer, look no further than
                    <br>
                    a jar of pickles. The results will surprise you and your friends.
